# DeepaMehta 4 Reviews Module

A DeepaMehta 4 module for users and developers who want to  extend a DeepaMehta 4 _Topic_- resp. _Association Type_ of their choice about a `Score`, a `Good!` or a `Soso`-field.

The plugin provides four **type-independent service methods** allowing to _upvote_, _downvote_ or _+1 on good_ or _+1 on so-so_ on 
_any_ given topic (provided by ID). Regarding which ones you prefer more, just add the corrspending child-topics to the _Topic Type_ definition of your choice and you can start to use the service.

## API: REST-Interface

 * GET `/review/upvote/{topicId}` - writes +1 `org.deepamehta.review.score`
 * GET `/review/downvote/{topicId}` - writes -1 on `org.deepamehta.review.score`
 * GET `/review/soso/{topicId}` - writes +1 on `org.deepamehta.review.soso`
 * GET `/review/good/{topicId}` - writes +1 on `org.deepamehta.review.good`
 
Note: This model is not compatible with the dm4-webclient. Simply because the DM Webclient tries sends _String_ values back to the server despite we actually defined a `dm4.core.number`-Data Type in our model. Make sure your data gets no invariance and therefore instantiate/migrate all your topics of the given type to have stored simple _Integer_ default values (e.g. 0) here.
